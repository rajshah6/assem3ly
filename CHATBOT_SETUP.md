```

## ⚙️ Configuration

All config is in `/frontend/app/api/assembly-chat/route.ts`:

```typescript
model: "reka-core"          // Best Reka chat model
temperature: 0.7            // Balanced creativity
max_tokens: 300             // ~2-3 sentences
stream: true                // Enable word-by-word streaming
```
