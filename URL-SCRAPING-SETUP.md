# 🔗 URL Scraping Feature - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes
**File**: `backend/src/api/routes.ts`
- ✅ Added new endpoint: `POST /api/scrape-url`
- ✅ Accepts IKEA product URLs directly
- ✅ Uses existing `scrapeProduct()` function (already supports URLs!)
- ✅ Downloads PDF and logs to terminal
- ✅ Returns scraped product data

### Frontend Changes

**File**: `frontend/lib/api-client.ts`
- ✅ Added `scrapeFromUrl()` function
- ✅ 90-second timeout for long scrapes
- ✅ Proper error handling

**File**: `frontend/components/search/search-section.tsx`
- ✅ Detects IKEA URLs automatically
- ✅ Shows URL as a clickable card result
- ✅ Updated placeholder text to mention URLs
- ✅ **UI unchanged** - looks exactly the same!

**File**: `frontend/components/library/library-card.tsx`
- ✅ TOMMARYD (product-0) uses existing static flow
- ✅ Custom URLs trigger backend scraping
- ✅ Shows `LoaderOne` during scraping (same as TOMMARYD)
- ✅ Navigates to `/assembly-preview` after success

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd /Users/ajith/Projects/assem3ly/backend
npm run dev
```

Should see:
```
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Start Frontend (in new terminal)
```bash
cd /Users/ajith/Projects/assem3ly/frontend
npm run dev
```

Should see:
```
▲ Next.js 15.x.x
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test URL Scraping

**Step 1**: Open http://localhost:3000

**Step 2**: Go to "Search" tab

**Step 3**: Paste this IKEA URL in the search box:
```
https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/billy-bookcase-white-00263850/
```

**Step 4**: You'll see a card appear: "Custom IKEA Product (from URL)"

**Step 5**: Click the card

**Step 6**: Watch the magic! ✨
- Frontend shows `LoaderOne` (animated dots)
- Backend terminal shows scraping progress:
  ```
  ============================================================
  📥 API Request: /api/scrape-url
  🔗 URL: https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/billy-bookcase-white-00263850/

  ============================================================
  ```

**Step 7**: After scraping completes → navigates to `/assembly-preview`

## 🎯 What Works

### ✅ URL Detection
- Paste any IKEA URL with `/p/` in it
- Automatically detected and shown as a card
- Works with all regional IKEA sites (.com, .co.uk, .de, etc.)

### ✅ Backend Scraping
- Uses Bright Data proxies
- Downloads PDF to `backend/data/pdfs/`
- Logs everything to terminal
- Returns product metadata

### ✅ Same UI Flow as TOMMARYD
- Shows `LoaderOne` animation
- Same loading time experience
- Same navigation to preview
- **Zero UI changes** - looks identical!

### ✅ Error Handling
- Invalid URLs show error
- Timeout after 90 seconds
- Network errors caught
- User-friendly alerts

## 🎨 UI Behavior

### Search Box
- **Before**: "e.g. BILLY Bookcase"
- **After**: "e.g. BILLY Bookcase or https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/..."

### Search Results
- **Product name search**: Shows matching products from TOP_50
- **URL paste**: Shows single card "Custom IKEA Product (from URL)"

### Loading State
- Same `LoaderOne` component as TOMMARYD
- Same 5-second feel (actual scraping time varies)
- Same navigation behavior

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Preview Data**: Currently shows static TOMMARYD data for all products
   - To fix: Need to integrate AI processing (Person 3's Gemini code)
   - Or: Pass scraped data to preview page

2. **No Product Info in Card**: URL-based cards show placeholder image
   - To fix: Could extract product name from URL or do quick preview scrape

3. **No Caching**: Each click re-scrapes the product
   - To fix: Add caching layer (check if PDF already exists)

4. **TOP_50 Products**: Still show "API limit" alert when clicked
   - To fix: Add `productUrl` field to TOP_50 data to enable scraping

---

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

### Option 1: Add URLs to TOP_50 Products
Edit `frontend/lib/top-50-data.ts` to include:
```typescript
{
  id: "product-1",
  name: "BILLY Bookcase",
  imageUrl: "/products/product-1.jpg",
  category: "Living Room",
  productUrl: "https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/billy-bookcase-white-00263850/"
}
```

Then all TOP_50 products will trigger scraping!

### Option 2: Integrate AI Processing
Connect to Person 3's Gemini code to process PDFs into 3D steps.

### Option 3: Add Caching
Check if PDF exists before re-scraping:
```typescript
const pdfPath = `backend/data/pdfs/${productId}.pdf`
if (fs.existsSync(pdfPath)) {
  return cached data
}
```
