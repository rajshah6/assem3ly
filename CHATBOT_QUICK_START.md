## 💡 Example Conversations

**User**: "What tools do I need?"
**Bot**: "For this step, you'll need: [lists tools]. Make sure everything is ready before starting!"

**User**: "How do I attach the bracket?"
**Bot**: "Attach the bracket to the side rails using the flathead screws provided. Position it carefully at the marks and tighten gradually for a secure fit."

**User**: "I can't find part X"
**Bot**: "For this step, you need 1x bracket_06 (flathead screw). Check your parts list—it should be a small metal screw with a flat head."
