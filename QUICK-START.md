- ✅ Logs to terminal

### Frontend
- ✅ URL detection in search
- ✅ Shows URL as clickable card

## 🎨 UI Behavior

**Search Box Placeholder**:
```
e.g. BILLY Bookcase or https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/...
```

**When you paste a URL**:
- Automatically detected
- Shows as a card result
- Click to trigger scraping

**When you search by name**:
- Shows matching products from library
- Works exactly as before

# Kill any process on port 3001
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9

# Try again
cd backend && npm run dev
```

### Frontend won't start?
```bash
# Kill any process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Try again
cd frontend && npm run dev

### "Missing .env file"?
