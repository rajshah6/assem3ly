# assembl3D - Project Mission & Vision

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

**IKEA assembly manuals are scattered across 30+ regional websites with no central database.**

### Pain Points:
1. **Lost your manual?** Good luck finding it online
2. **Static PDFs** are hard to read on phone screens
3. **No search functionality** across IKEA's manual library
4. **First-time assemblers** get confused by 2D diagrams
5. **No interactivity** - can't zoom, rotate, or ask questions

## 💡 Our Solution: assembl3D

**"Just type what furniture you have - we'll find it, process it, and give you an interactive 3D guide"**

### User Experience Flow:

1. **Search** → User types "Billy Bookcase"
2. **Scrape** → We find and download the manual using Bright Data (~30s)
3. **Process** → AI extracts step-by-step instructions with Gemini (~60s)
4. **View** → Interactive 3D assembly guide with Three.js

### Features:
- 🔍 Smart search across all IKEA products
- 🤖 AI-powered instruction extraction
- 🎨 3D visualization of each assembly step
- 📱 Mobile-friendly interface
- ⚡ Fast (<90 seconds end-to-end)

## 🏆 Why This Wins the Hackathon

### 1. Solves a Real Problem
- Anyone who's assembled IKEA furniture knows the struggle
- Addresses a gap: no central manual database exists
- Makes a tedious task actually enjoyable

### 2. Showcases Bright Data Products
- ✅ **SERP API**: Search Google/IKEA for products
- ✅ **Web Scraper**: Extract product data from IKEA pages
- ✅ **Web Unlocker**: Download PDFs that block scrapers
- ✅ **Residential Proxies**: Access regional IKEA sites

### 3. Technical Complexity
- Combines 3 cutting-edge technologies
- Full-stack application
- Real-time processing pipeline

### 4. Impressive Demo
- Live scraping and processing
- Beautiful 3D visualization
- Fast results
- Works reliably for 5+ demo products

## 🎬 Demo Story

### Opening Hook:
> "Have you ever lost an IKEA manual? There's no central database - 9,500 products scattered across 30 websites. We built the world's first intelligent furniture assembly assistant."

### Live Demo Flow:
1. **Search**: "Watch - I'll search for 'MALM dresser'"
2. **Behind the scenes**: Bright Data finds and scrapes it
3. **AI Processing**: Gemini extracts 3D instructions
4. **Result**: Interactive 3D guide you can rotate and explore

### Closing Impact:
> "Bright Data gave us 95% success rate finding PDFs. Without it, we'd need weeks of manual collection. With it, any furniture manual is accessible instantly."
